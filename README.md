# Dictionary Website

I started creating this in week8 of The School of Code. My main aim was revising fetching from an API and calling a fetch on click of a button.

This repo will allow me to practise fetching data from an API (https://dictionaryapi.dev/) and manipulate the DOM to display words and definitions on the page.


I am also using a random word API (http://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home) to allow the user to fetch a random word from the Dictionary API.

## Things to add:

- I'd like to improve the UI of this page
    - Look at some other examples, what is the user expecting from this website?
- Improve the colours - again, look at other examples 
- Alter the CSS accordingly.
- Add functionality
     - Add certain words to a list on click?
