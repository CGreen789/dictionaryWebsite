# Dictionary Website

I'm using Week 8 at The School of Code to recap topics covered so far in the course. 

This repo will allow me to practise fetching data from an API (https://dictionaryapi.dev/) and manipulate the DOM to display words and definitions on the page.


I am also using a random word API (http://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home) to allow the user to fetch a random word from the Dictionary API.
